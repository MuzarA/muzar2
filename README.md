# Employee Database Management Application

## Description

This Java application interacts with a relational database to manage employee data using JDBC. It implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an `Employee` table in a PostgreSQL database. The application consists of two main classes:

1. **Employee** - A simple entity class that represents an employee, containing fields such as `id`, `name`, `position`, `salary`, and `hireDate`.
2. **EmployeeData** - A class responsible for handling CRUD operations, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting employee records from the database.

The project uses JDBC for database connectivity and follows Object-Oriented Programming principles, ensuring encapsulation and proper structure.

## Requirements

### Database Setup

1. **Create the database:**
   - Name: `employee_db`
   
2. **Create the `employee` table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employee (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       position VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       salary DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
       hire_date DATE NOT NULL
   );
   ```

### Employee Entity Class

The `Employee` class contains the following fields:
- `id` (int): Employee's unique ID, auto-generated by the database.
- `name` (String): Employee's name.
- `position` (String): Employee's position.
- `salary` (double): Employee's salary.
- `hireDate` (Date): Date the employee was hired.

The class provides:
- Constructors, getters, setters, and `toString()` method for data manipulation and display.

### EmployeeData Class

The `EmployeeData` class is responsible for managing CRUD operations using JDBC. It contains methods for the following actions:
1. **createEmployee(Employee employee)**: Inserts a new employee into the `employee` table.
2. **getEmployeeById(int id)**: Retrieves an employee’s details by ID.
3. **getAllEmployees()**: Retrieves all employees from the database.
4. **updateEmployee(Employee employee)**: Updates the details of an existing employee.
5. **deleteEmployee(int id)**: Deletes an employee from the table by ID.

### Database Connection

The application uses JDBC to connect to the `employee_db` database. A dedicated method is provided to establish and return the connection to the database, handling resource management using try-catch blocks.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

1. **Database:**
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a database named `employee_db`.
   - Execute the SQL script above to create the `employee` table.
   
2. **JDBC Driver:**
   - Include the PostgreSQL JDBC driver in your `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven (already included in the provided `pom.xml`).

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nurjamal505/Employee-Database-Management.git
   cd Employee-Database-Management
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   You can run the main program directly:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

### Example Output

- After running the program, the following operations will be performed:
  - A new employee `John Lee` will be created.
  - A new employee `Cindy Smith` will be created.
  - The employee details for `id = 22` will be retrieved and displayed.
  - All employees will be listed.
  - Employee data for `id = 22` will be updated.
  - Employee with `id = 23` will be deleted.

## Example Code

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmployeeData employeeData = new EmployeeData();

        employeeData.deleteAllEmployees();

        Employee newEmployee1 = new Employee(0, "John Lee", "Developer", 60000, new Date());
        employeeData.createEmployee(newEmployee1);

        Employee newEmployee2 = new Employee(0, "Cindy Smith", "Developer", 65000, new Date());
        employeeData.createEmployee(newEmployee2);

        Employee employee = employeeData.getEmployeeById(1);
        System.out.println(employee);

        List<Employee> employees = employeeData.getAllEmployees();
        for (Employee emp : employees) {
            System.out.println(emp);
        }

        if (employee != null) {
            employee.setSalary(65000);
            employeeData.updateEmployee(employee);
        }

        employeeData.deleteEmployee(1);
    }
}
```

### Sample Database State:

**Before Running:**
- Empty `employee` table.

**After Running:**
- The `employee` table should contain two records with `id` values assigned by the database.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correct Usage of OOP**: The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles, such as encapsulation, constructors, getters/setters, and methods.
- **Code Quality**: The code follows best practices, with clear variable names, concise methods, and proper exception handling.
- **Completeness**: The project includes all required features: CRUD operations, database interaction, and a working main method for testing.
- **GitHub Repository**: The project is properly uploaded to GitHub with a descriptive README file and sample output screenshots.
